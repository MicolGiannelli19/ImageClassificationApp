to create the react app I did 

```
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript

```

```tsconfig``` file contains the the configurations for typscripts including versions and stuff, src is what defines what our components actually are 

cose su come si impara 

when youy finsh the changes you have to do something like ```npm run build```
